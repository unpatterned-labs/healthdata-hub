## Health Data Hub
            An open-source workflow for harmonizing health facility data from multiple sources.

At Unpatterned AI Labs, we are building an open-source global unified data platform to provide high-quality, accessible, and harmonized datasets for researchers, policymakers, and organizations. 
Health systems worldwide struggle with fragmented, inconsistent, and hard-to-use datasets, limiting their ability to plan, allocate resources, and improve healthcare delivery. 
While initiatives like WHO’s Geolocated Health Facilities Data (GHFD) project aim to close this gap, many countries still lack clean, standardized, and easily integrable datasets. We aim to change that.

Our focus is on global health data, leveraging sources like Healthsites, Overture Maps, and OpenStreetMap (OSM) to ensure data is structured and easy to use. 
Rather than collecting new data, our goal is to aggregate, harmonize, and simplify access to existing datasets through Python and R libraries, making it easier for developers, researchers, and organizations to integrate these datasets into their workflows.

### The Problem
Despite the abundance of open health data, key challenges remain:
- Fragmented & Scattered Data – Health facility data exists across multiple platforms with no unified access point. 
- Lack of Structured & Usable Data – Many datasets are difficult to integrate due to inconsistent formats. Or in Xlsx, CSV and JSON format
- Data Accessibility Barriers – No standardized, developer-friendly tools to utilize these datasets efficiently.

### Our Solution
We are building an open-source Python & R libraries to:
- ✅ Provide harmonized health facility data from multiple sources. 
- ✅ Enable seamless access for research, analytics, and AI applications.
- ✅ Ensure data presence verification (not validation).
- ✅ Support privacy-aware usage based on data-sharing policies.

### Why This Matters
By combining open data, AI-driven insights, and ethical governance, Unpatterned AI Labs is redefining how global health information is accessed, understood, and applied—driving smarter decision-making for a more resilient and equitable healthcare future
