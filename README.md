# **Health Data Hub**  

                    📊 An open-source workflow for harmonizing health facility data from multiple sources. 
---

At **Unpatterned AI Labs**, we are building an **open-source global unified data platform** to provide high-quality, accessible, and harmonized datasets for researchers, policymakers, and organizations.  

Health systems worldwide struggle with **fragmented, inconsistent, and hard-to-use datasets**, limiting their ability to plan, allocate resources, and improve healthcare delivery. While initiatives like **WHO’s Geolocated Health Facilities Data (GHFD) project** aim to close this gap, many countries still lack **clean, standardized, and easily integrable datasets**. We aim to change that.  

## 🌍 **What We're Doing**  
We are curating and harmonizing **health facility data** from multiple sources, including:  
- **Healthsites.io**  
- **Overture Maps**  
- **OpenStreetMap (OSM)**  
- **Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX)**  

Rather than collecting new data, our focus is on **aggregating, standardizing, and simplifying access** to existing datasets using **Python and R**. Our libraries will enable developers, researchers, and organizations to seamlessly integrate health data into their workflows.  

## 🚨 **The Problem We’re Solving**  
Despite the abundance of open health data, key challenges remain:  
❌ **Fragmented & Scattered Data** – Health facility data exists across multiple platforms with no unified access point.  
❌ **Lack of Structured & Usable Data** – Many datasets are difficult to integrate due to inconsistent formats (Excel, CSV, JSON).  
❌ **Data Accessibility Barriers** – No standardized, developer-friendly tools for working with these datasets efficiently.  

## ✅ **Our Solution**  
We are building an open-source **Python & R libraries** that:  
✅ Provide **harmonized** health facility data from multiple sources.  
✅ Enable **seamless access** for research, analytics, and AI applications.  
✅ Ensure **data presence verification** (not validation).  
✅ Support **privacy-aware** usage based on data-sharing policies.  

## 💡 **Why This Matters**  
By combining **open data, AI-driven insights, and ethical governance**, we’re making **health data more accessible and actionable**.  

✔️ **Empowers researchers & policymakers** with structured health data.  
✔️ **Reduces fragmentation & improves accessibility** of global health facility data.  
✔️ **Encourages collaboration** between health organizations and data providers.  
✔️ **Sets the foundation for AI-driven insights & decision-making.**
